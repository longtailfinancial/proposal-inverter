      - A broker is added to the waitlist. This is where all brokers are stored
        until they are whitelisted. There is no blacklist so that voters can
        change their vote at a later time.

        more than a single vote for a broker to be whitelisted.
      - Once enough votes for a broker has been cast, the broker is removed from
        the waitlist and is added to the whitelist.
